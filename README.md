# Landing Page Project

## Project Description

This project is a dynamic landing page that builds a navigation menu based on the sections present in the HTML. It includes features such as smooth scrolling, highlighting the active section in the viewport, hiding the navigation bar while not scrolling, and a scroll-to-top button. The project is designed to be responsive and works across modern desktops, tablets, and phone browsers.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. The navigation menu will be dynamically generated based on the sections in the HTML. You can click on the navigation items to smoothly scroll to the respective sections. The active section will be highlighted as you scroll through the page. The navigation bar will hide when you stop scrolling and reappear when you start scrolling again. A scroll-to-top button will appear when you scroll below the fold of the page.
